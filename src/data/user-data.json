    "bio": "I'm Ryan Gomes Marques Romão, 22 years old, and completely passionate about technology. Currently, I work independently as a Computer Assembly and Maintenance Technician, which allows me to get hands-on and help people keep their equipment running perfectly. My journey into the world of technology truly began at the Federal Institute of Rio de Janeiro - IFRJ, where I graduated as an Internet IT Technician. Initially, my focus was on Front-End (the part of web development that users see and interact with). But fortunately, the extracurricular activities I had access to at IFRJ opened my eyes to Full-Stack development, and that's when everything expanded. Today, I move with ease between what's 'behind' and what's 'in front' of an application. For Back-End, I have knowledge in languages like MySQL, PHP, and Golang, which allow me to build all the logic and database for robust systems. And on the Front-End, I master modern tools and frameworks like React.js, Next.js, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript, in addition to the essential HTML5 and CSS3. I enjoy creating dynamic interfaces that provide a great user experience. Currently, I'm deepening my knowledge even further by studying Software Engineering at the Fundação Severino Sombra (UniVassouras). For me, every class and every project is an opportunity to improve, enhance my skills, and grow increasingly in the vast field of Information Technology. My goal is clear: to become an even more well-rounded professional, ready for the challenges that the future holds."
